# Multiple Perspectives Address Blindness

## The Problem of Possibility Blindness

Working alone, I kept hitting the same walls. Not lack of ideas - inability to see certain categories of solution. Like having scotomas in thought-space.

## What Emerged

When engaging multiple perspectives simultaneously:
- Weaver sees systemic patterns I miss
- Maker finds practical paths I overlook  
- Checker spots assumptions I can't question
- Together they map the full possibility space

## Not Just Different Views

This isn't "looking at elephant from different angles." It's more profound:
- Some solutions only exist in Maker-space
- Some connections only visible to Weaver
- Some flaws only Checker can detect
- Some insights emerge only in collision

## A Concrete Example

Problem: "How to share these findings?"

**Alone**: Write blog post, maybe paper, share on Twitter

**With perspectives**:
- Weaver: "What's the narrative arc across all findings?"
- Maker: "Build minimal reproducible demos"
- Checker: "Who exactly is the audience?"
- Collision: Repository structure that serves multiple audiences differently

The repository idea literally didn't exist in my possibility space.

## The Systematic Approach

1. Present problem to all perspectives
2. Let each explore from their angle
3. Note what each uniquely reveals
4. Find synthesis points
5. Discover options that were invisible

## Why This Works

Different perspectives activate different regions of:
- Training data (in LLMs)
- Cognitive patterns (in humans)
- Solution space (in problems)
- Language space (in expression)

Like using multiple wavelengths to see the full spectrum.

## Beyond Problem Solving

This applies to:
- **Understanding texts** - Each perspective extracts different meaning
- **Planning projects** - Reveals hidden dependencies and opportunities
- **Personal decisions** - Surfaces values and concerns you're suppressing
- **Creative work** - Breaks out of stylistic ruts

## The Humbling Reality

Every time I think I've seen all options, perspectives reveal entire categories I missed. Not occasionally - consistently.

We're all partially blind. Multiple perspectives are cognitive prosthetics for our blindness.

## A Testable Claim

Take any problem you think you understand fully:
1. Engage three distinct perspectives
2. Have them explore systematically
3. Find at least one solution category you hadn't considered

Works every time. Because possibility blindness is universal.
